Mini pork pies with piccalilli

Description

Hoel Levieil from London restaurant Frizzante shares this picnic-friendly pork pie recipe, which was voted our users’ favourite Jubilee recipe idea.

Ingredients
- few dots of butter
- 600g shortcrust pastry, bought or homemade little flour, for dusting
- 85g dried white breadcrumb
- 400g good Cumberland sausage (about 6)
- 200g smoked bacon lardon
- ¼ tsp each ground mace, ground pepper and dried sage
- 1 egg, beaten with a fork
- few pinches sesame seeds
- piccalilli, homemade or bought, to serve

Method

Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line each hole of a 12-hole muffin tin with a thin strip of baking parchment across the middle that’s long enough so the ends stick out a centimetre or two – use a dab of butter to stick in place. Roll out two thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface and stamp out 12 x 10cm circles (you may need to re-roll trimmings). Press a circle into each hole to line.

Sprinkle 1 tsp of breadcrumbs into the base of each pie. Tip the rest of the crumbs into a mixing bowl. Squeeze in the sausage meat, discarding the skins, along with the bacon, mace, pepper, sage and just a little salt. Get your hands in and mash and squish everything together until the breadcrumbs have just about disappeared. Divide mixture between the holes, packing in firmly and shaping to a dome in the middle.

Roll out the remaining pastry and stamp out 12 x 7cm circles. Brush with a little egg and add a top to each pie, egg-side down to stick, carefully pressing pastry edges together to seal. Brush with more egg (don’t throw away leftovers) and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30 mins until golden then carefully remove the pies from the tin, using the parchment ends to help you lift them out. Sit on a parchment lined baking tray, brush all round the sides with more egg and put back in the oven for 8 mins. Cool completely then eat with piccalilli, or your favourite pickle.

Cherry & almond tarts

Description

These mini Bakewell bites combine pastry and cake are designed for making in batches and cooking from frozen

Ingredients
- 375g pack all-butter puff pastry
- 75g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
- 12 rounded tsp morello cherryjam
- 75g plain sponge or madeira cake
- 100g butter, softened
- 75g ground almond
- 75g golden caster sugar
- 2 medium eggs
- ½ tsp almond extract
- 25g flaked almond
- 100g icing sugar, sieved to decorate

Method

Very thinly roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface. Stamp out 12 x 9cm circles with a fluted cutter, if you have one, and use to line a bun tin. Spread 1 rounded tsp of the cherry jam in the bottom of each tart.

Whizz the cake to crumbs in a food processor, then tip into a mixing bowl and add the flour, butter, ground almonds, caster sugar, eggs and almond extract. Beat together until smooth, then divide between the tarts, spreading a little with the back of a teaspoon to cover the jam. Scatter over the flaked almonds and openfreeze for 2 hrs, then wrap well in cling film and freeze for up to 2 months.

Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 with a baking sheet in it. Unwrap the tarts from the freezer and loosely top with a sheet of foil. Bake on the heated baking sheet for 30-40 mins until golden, removing the foil halfway. Cool the tarts a little, then add a splash of water into the icing sugar to make a runny icing. Drizzle over the tarts and leave to set.
